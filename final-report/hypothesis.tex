\section{Hypotheses}
For this project, we will be testing 2 hypotheses:

\textbf{Hypothesis 1}: We epxect the Q Learning algorithm to perform better overall than the SARSA algorithm over 10000 episodes.
%We expect both the Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms to be able to finish training after 1000 episodes and that the SARSA algorithm will have the 
%higher average rewards over 100 episodes.

\textbf{Hypothesis 2}: For both algorithms, we expect exponential decay of $\epsilon$ to perform the best, as in, have the highest average reward over 10000 episodes.

Both Airi and Khoi's experiments will be performed in accordance to these hypotheses.
