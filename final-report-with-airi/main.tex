\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2023} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2023} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}


% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2023}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
% \usepackage[accepted]{icml2022}

% For theorems and such
\usepackage{amsmath}

% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2022
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% Our main goal in the next week or so is to finish the training for both algorithms, and then find a way to save it to memory, making it easily recallable in a fresh environment.

% Secondly, as mentioned above, we will be doing sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters; namely $\alpha$, $\gamma$, $\epsilon$ and see how it would
% affect our algorithms.

% Third, for Khoi's SARSA algorithms, he wants to explore using SARSA($\Lambda$) and compare it to the current SARSA run. 

% Fourth, for both algorithms, we will explore different methods for $\epsilon$ decay. Currently, $\epsilon$ is kept at a constant 0.1 for both algorithms.
% Exploring $\epsilon$ decay (such as exponential decay) will provide some useful insights for the comparison of the algorithms.

% Finally, we want to refine our training to fit our hypothesis of being able to finish training in 1000 episodes and make SARSA outperform Q-Learning.
% Additionally, after we have successfully trained the agent, we want to be able to render a video of the game being played; and save the video for presentation purposes.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022. 
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
